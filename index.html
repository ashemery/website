			<h2>Teaching</h2>
			
<p>As an experienced technical instructor specializing in the Linux operating system, my teaching philosophy centers on the belief that active student participation is key to meaningful learning and long-term success. Throughout my work with various companies and organizations, Iâ€™ve consistently found that the most impactful learning environments are those where students are fully engaged in the process.</p>

<p>To foster this engagement, I carefully structure each lecture to provide a clear, logical framework that guides students through the material. This organization not only enhances comprehension but also builds the confidence students need to ask questions and seek clarification.</p>

<p>I also prioritize creating a participatory classroom culture by posing thoughtful, open-ended questions to individual students, sparking discussion and encouraging deeper exploration of the subject matter. These interactions help transform passive learners into active contributors.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my goal is not just to help students learn Linux, but to ensure they retain that knowledge and feel empowered to apply it beyond the classroom. I aim to instill a sense of curiosity, confidence, and a lasting passion for learning that will continue to grow throughout their careers.</p>
