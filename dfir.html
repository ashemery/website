<li><h3><a name="Challenge5">Challenge #5</a> - BSides Amman 2021 2nd Edition / Windows Forensics Workshop Case</li></h3>
<p>CASE OVERVIEW: You have been given a system that has been used for some illegal activity were the user accessed confidential files that the user was 
	not supposed to access. The system has two user accounts which are the main suspects involved in this case ("joker" and "IEUser"). 
	You are required to provide answers to all the questions below by providing evidence (proof) with details and screenshots. 
	Remember: SCREENSHOT OR IT DID NOT HAPPEN ;)
	
<p>All of the case files can be found <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/kdACjRiI#BE3z6CfuEP_ESzlf-M99cQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>They can also be found <a href="https://github.com/ashemery/WindowsDFIR" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/download/BSidesAmman21.E01" target="_blank">here</a> too.</p>

To successfully solve this challenge, a report with answers to the tasks below is required:
<ol>
	<li> What is the hash value for the given forensic image?
	<li> Which user account was used to access some confidential documents?</li>
	<li> Explain in detail what proof do you have to support your answer?</li>
	<li> Did the user access the confidential files from a local drive or network location?</li>
	<li> What proof do you have to support your answer?</li>
	<li> List all the files that were accessed with full paths.</li>
	<li> Provide two different evidence to prove that those files were truly accessed.</li>
	<li> Which application was used to open any of the confidential document(s)?</li>

	The next three questions are related to the image with the text "AnotherPassword4U" found inside the user's home directory.
	<li> What is the full path to the files of interest? </li>
	<li> What is the Volume Serial Number where the file exists? </li>
	<li> What are the Modified, Accessed, and Creation (MAC) timestamps in UTC for the file? </li>

	The DCode.exe application was used by one of the users. Provide evidence to the next four questions below, but, be careful, this is a tricky question!!!
	<li> Which user do you think ran the application and what evidence do you have to support your hypothesis? </li>
	<li> How many times was it used? </li>
	<li> When was it last used? </li>
	<li> Where was the application located (full path)? </li>
</ol>

<li><h3><a name="Challenge7">Challenge #7</a> - SysInternals Case</li></h3>
<p>The user downloaded what they thought was the SysInternals tool suite, double-clicked it, but the tools did not open and were not accessible. Since that time, the user has noticed that the system has "slowed down" and become less and less responsive.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Goal is to determine what happened, and when.</li>
    <li>Files could be found here: <a href="https://mega.nz/file/fi4hlRYB#2y5NN0wnk1_dKsFDjYnpTs4nbmSbPPedeVDDKGTA1Gk" target="_blank">Mega</a>

<li><h3><a name="Challenge8">Challenge #8</a> - NTFS File System Case</li></h3>
<p>In this case you are required to find all the data and files that have been hidden using some of the NTFS file system capabilities.</p>
<ol>
	<li>E01 for the drive could be found: <a href="https://archive.org/details/ntfs-hidden-files" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>There are 5 hidden things for you to find!</li>
	<li>Explain how these files were hidden</li>
	<li>For more detailed instructions, please check this case under cases at <a href="https://academy.cyber5w.com/collections/case-studies" target="_blank">here</a></li>
</ol>
<p>End of Case.</p><hr>

<li><h3><a name="Challenge9">Challenge #9</a> - Encrypt Them All Case</li></h3>
<p>In this case you are required to decrypt all the data and files that have been encrypted using different crypto methods.</p>
<ol>
	<li>E01 for the drive could be found: <a href="https://archive.org/details/anti-forensics-case-2" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>#1: Lost in Space: <p>We noticed that the whole communication started with a README file within the users documents directory. Unfortunately, this file seems to be encrypted with AES and we do not have the password to decrypt it. You would either need to search the cache for the communication or try to recover the file before it was encrypted. It seems this file leads to the solution of our next requirement.</p></li>
	<li>#2: Do Not Be Deceived!: <p>It seems Jane has been using a volume with full disk encryption (Bitlocker). It has been applied to a volume named R2D2. You are required to decrypt this volume and find what was hidden within it.</p></li>
    <li>#3: "Your Focus Determines Your Reality.": <p>One of the messages sent to the unknown part seemed to be using asymmetric encryption with a Public/Private key. Since we were able to acquire an image of Jane’s system, you should be able to extract these keys and use them to decrypt the message. The message which has been shared with our unknown third party, is within the keys file within the user’s download directory. You need to decrypt this file in order to get the secret message. Do you know what this was used for?</p></li>
	<li>For more detailed instructions, please check this case under cases at <a href="https://academy.cyber5w.com/collections/case-studies" target="_blank">here</a></li>

<li><h3><a name="Challenge10">Challenge #10</a> - Meeting Location Case</li></h3>
<p>Our suspect Max, seems to be part of a foreign intelligence group and our intelligence team has been tracking him for months now. It seems Max has agreed to meet with an unknown party at some location. After Max left his apartment, we were able to acquire an image of his system. Unfortunately, when we did our investigation, we did not find anything. We are sure that Max has no other system and this is the only system he uses. We need your help with this investigation. The faster you are able to retrieve the info, the quicker we will be able to stop their next operations.</p>
<ol>
	<li>E01 for the drive could be found: <a href="https://archive.org/details/anti-forensics-case-4" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>Deliverable #1: Where is the Evidence?<p>You need to find answers with explanations to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is Max using to hide his activity?</li>
            <li>Find and restore the methods/tools/techniques/etc that he is using. Note: This might require data recovery/carving</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>Deliverable #2: Where are they Meeting?<p>After you have found the methods that Max has been using to hide his tracks, you are required to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find out what Max was searching for based on analyzing the browser history.</li>
            <li>We believe that Max received the information about the meeting location in an encrypted file. Search for that file and after decrypting the file (if needed), determine the meeting location.</li>
            <li>What was the name of the file that has the meeting location?</li>
            <li>From where did Max get the meeting location (URL, chat, email, etc)?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>Deliverable #3: Reflection<p>Reflect on what you learned from this case.</p></li>
